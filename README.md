   Navigate to the directory where you cloned the repository and run the `calculator.py` file:

   ```bash
   python calculator.py
   ```

## Usage

The calculator has a user-friendly interface with buttons for each digit, basic arithmetic operations, square root, power, and clear functionality.

### Buttons

- **Digits (0-9)**: Press these buttons to input numbers.
- **Arithmetic Operations**: `+`, `-`, `x`, `/` buttons for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division respectively.
- **Special Functions**: 
  - `\u221A`: Square root.
  - `pow`: Power.
- **Clear**: `cls` button to reset the input and clear the display.
- **Decimal Point**: `.` button to input decimal numbers.
- **Equals**: `=` button to calculate and display the result.

### Example Calculations

1. **Addition**: To add 5 and 3, press `5`, `+`, `3`, `=`.
2. **Square Root**: To find the square root of 16, press `16`, `\u221A`, `=`.
3. **Power**: To calculate 2 raised to the power of 3, press `2`, `pow`, `3`, `=`.
